# PlotXYColor
class for easily plotting multidimensional data in 3 dimensions: x, y, color

This is precursor to FluCoMa's **FluidPlotter** class. **FluidPlotter** is designed for simpler interface with other FluCoMa objects, specifically [FluidDataSet](https://learn.flucoma.org/reference/dataset/). **PlotXYColor** may still be useful to keep around because it has some additional functionality that **FluidPlotter** does not, such as the ability to load in datasets of an arbitrary number of dimensions and then select from a dropdown which dimensions to view.
